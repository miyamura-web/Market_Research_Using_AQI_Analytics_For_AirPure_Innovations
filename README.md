# Market Research using AQI Analytics for AirPure Innovations

## 🌐 Introduction
AirPure Innovations is a data-driven startup aiming to address India's growing air pollution crisis through smart air purification technologies. This repository provides an end-to-end market research and analytics project using AQI (Air Quality Index) data to assess the demand, consumer behavior, and regional prioritization for air purifier deployment.

## Project Objective :
To evaluate the market potential for air purifiers in Indian cities by analyzing AQI data, public awareness, health perception, and vehicle data. The insights aim to guide strategic decision-making in product development, targeting, and advocacy. For more details see the attach file "problem_statement".
